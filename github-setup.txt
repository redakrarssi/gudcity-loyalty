# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to push your code to GitHub:

## Step 1: Create a new repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Enter repository name: `gudcity-loyalty`
3. Add a description (optional): "Customer loyalty platform for businesses"
4. Choose public or private repository
5. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Link your local repository to GitHub
Once your GitHub repository is created, run these commands:

```
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gudcity-loyalty.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If you're prompted for credentials, enter your GitHub username and password or personal access token.

## Alternative: Command Line Setup
If you prefer to create the repository from the command line, you can use the GitHub CLI:

```
# Install GitHub CLI if you don't have it
# Then login and create repository
gh auth login
gh repo create gudcity-loyalty --private --source=. --remote=origin
git push -u origin main
```

## Verification
After pushing, visit your GitHub profile to verify the repository has been created and all files are uploaded correctly.
